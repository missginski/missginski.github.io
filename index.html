          <p>I’m an ex-sound engineer who enjoys being creative with technology. Over the last 3 years, I worked at a fast-paced startup in a content-related role, but took an interest in web development. After coding a few HTML emails for our team, I knew that this was something I would love to do for a living. That’s when I decided to pursue  a career in Web Development. I always take pride in my work, I’m intensely curious, and I’m never satisfied until the job is done. I know I’ve got a long road ahead, but I’ve found a craft that is undeniably rewarding for me, and I’ve never been more excited to get to work.</p>

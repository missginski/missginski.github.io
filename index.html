    <p>Hi, I'm Kristyn. I'm a developer based in NYC. I like problem solving and writing clean code. I recently graduated from General Assembly Web Development Immersive.</p>
    <p>Check out some of my projects</p>
    <p>Drop Shop is a fun, light weight weather app, and outfit planning assistant. I wanted to play with the idea of using different sets of data in correlation with one another. I used PostgreSQL to build out a database to act as a go between for the APIâ€™s, and Express.js for some simple routes.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you're interested in some of my work, I would love to chat.</p>
